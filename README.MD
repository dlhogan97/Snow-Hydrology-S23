# Snow Hydrology Final Project Spring 2023
### University of Washington
### Written by Daniel Hogan

This repository includes, data, a script, and a notebook to walk someone through using the xarray snow pit dataset that was compiled from the Sublimation of Snow campagin in Winter 2023. Running the `snow_pit_parser.py` script will produce the dataset from the data already downloaded on this repository. Then some questions can be investigated using the `snow_pit_lab.ipynb` notebook.
